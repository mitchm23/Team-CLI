This is a program designed to create a webpage that creates dedicated cards for your team, based on the responses to a set of queries given to you in the terminal.

This ended up being the most challenging assignment yet, and I started over at least five times because I was so lost. Once I met with my tutor and really understood contructors a bit more, however, I managed to create a project that mostly functioned correctly without any errors.

I say mostly, because I cannot understand how to get the htmlRenderer to work. This is what I have completed up until this point, and I will be asking my tutor for help when I meet with him so that I can finish the final step and have something I'm proud of.
